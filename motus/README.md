# 🎮 MOTUS – My First JavaScript Project

## 📖 Description
*MOTUS* is my very first real project coded in pure **JavaScript**.  
It's a small word-guessing game inspired by the classic TV show, created following a mock client brief.  
I'm really proud of this one — it shows my progress step by step in the world of web development.
